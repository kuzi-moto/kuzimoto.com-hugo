# Better Late than Never

It's been just over 10 years since I first got this domain, and I am now finally doing something with it. There have been attempts in the past, for a little bit it was a phpBB forum for my friends and I. Mostly it was just sort of a scratch space to play with little ideas, or as file storage. I installed WordPress at least two or three times, but never got one post out. I think it was more fun setting things up than it was actually using it. At least the practice was somewhat educational.

I wish that I was ab let to start something sooner, but I'm glad to have something now. Every time I read someone else's blog I remember how I have neglected mine. I think I had a certain vision for it and was always discouraged that I couldn't get it exactly right. 


I finally managed to get a blog off the ground. This has been several years in the making, but just never was able to get something totally finished. I was pretty close a couple times though, getting as far installing WordPress, picking out a theme, and attempting to write a couple posts. But for some reason it always felt like something was missing.

I really wanted the design to be perfect, and unique - or at least one of my own making. Sure I could pick out one of the hundreds of free themes out there and tweak it a bit but wouldn't be something I could call my own. After all, a blog is somewhat of a personal thing. Someone posting about their thoughts and ideas, it seems fitting that the theme would reflect that.

In retrospect I feel (and I'm sure to others) it was somewhat silly, as the content should be more important than the presentation. But still, it was challenging to ignore since I can be a bit of a perfectionist, and picky.

## Introducing Hugo
> Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.

As written on Hugo's [Home Page](https://gohugo.io), and I would have to agree. I haven't built a complete website from scratch, but in a few minutes Hugo gives a pretty solid foundation to easily create pages without having to write in HTML.

Instead, Hugo takes content written in Markdown and runs it through templates, then spit out the final site that's ready to deploy on a web server. Or, you can host it with GitHub pages for free! Simple sites are generated within milliseconds, and bigger ones within seconds
