# Better Late than Never

It's been just over 10 years since I first got this domain, and I am now finally doing something with it. There have been attempts in the past, for a little bit it was a phpBB forum for my friends and I. Mostly it was just sort of a scratch space to play with little ideas, or as file storage. I installed WordPress at least two or three times, but never got one post out. I think it was more fun setting things up than it was actually using it. At least the practice was somewhat educational.

I wish that I was able to start something sooner, but I'm glad to have something now. Every time I read someone else's blog I remember how I have neglected mine. I think I had a certain vision for it and was always discouraged that I couldn't get it exactly right. With WordPress there are so many different themes, a plethora of plugins, and numerous configuration settings that I got all wrapped up in tweaking everything than actually writing. I felt like if I'm going to have a blog that it should be personal. I wanted to make my own theme but even starting from a boilerplate without much experience it's a bit overwhelming.

On top of that, I can be a bit of a perfectionist and was never very satisfied with what I did. Now I just want to have something out there, and I can always tweak it if there are errors.

## Why Blog

I have always like the blog format for a number of reasons. I think they are easy to read, 

## Why Hugo

Hugo makes the process of creating a website really easy. All of your content is stored in markdown files, which is essentially a plain text file, with some additional formatting. No database to set up, or specific editor to use. You have complete freedom over how you want to do things. You don't even need to pay for hosting with GitHub or GitLab Pages.

I don't want to go into too much detail in this post, I'll probably make another one in the future as I spend more time with it and can write about it in depth. But I'm excited for the future, and to finally get to writing.
