# Introduction

I finally managed to get a blog off the ground. This has been several years in the making, but just never was able to get it completely off the ground. I was pretty close a couple times though, getting as far installing WordPress, picking out a theme, and attempting to write a couple posts. But for some reason it always felt like something was missing. I really wanted the design to be perfect, and unique - or at least one of my own making. Sure I could pick out one of the hundreds of free themes out there and tweak it a bit but wouldn't be something I could call my own. After all, a blog is somewhat of a personal thing. Someone posting about their thoughts and ideas, it seems fitting that the theme would reflect that, and that would hold me back. In retrospect (and I'm sure to others) it was somewhat silly, as the content should be more important than the presentation. But still, it was challenging to ignore since I can be a perfectionist.

# Introducing Hugo
"Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again", according to the [Home Page](https://gohugo.io). And so far, I have to agree. It is slightly daunting at first, but I knew right away that it was something I wanted to try out.
